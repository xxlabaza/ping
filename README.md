# Ping

A client-server program for determining network round trip time.

## Overview

**Ping** is a client-server program. The programâ€™s aim is to test the IP network and to determine RTT (Round Trip Time).

The program has two main functioning modes:

* **Pitcher mode** (message thrower) runs on the first, "A", computer and have the functionality of generating and sending messages to another computer.

* **Catcher mode** (message catcher) runs on the second, "B", computer and have the functionality of receiving the message and sending replies to the message sender back.

The output of the program (in **pitcher** mode) shows the following:

* time in HH:mm:ss.SSS format;
* total number of sent messages;

* the number of sent messages in the previous second (speed);

* average time in the last second needed for the message to complete a cycle (A->B->A);

* total maximum time needed for the message to complete a cycle (A->B->A);

* average time for the previous second needed for the message to come from A to B (A-> B);

* average time for the previous second needed for the message to come from B to A (B-> A).

Example of output (**pitcher** mode):

```bash
$> java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar -p -port 9090 localhost
16:36:38.379 INFO  [main] : Pitcher mode enabled
16:36:39.442 INFO  [pool-3-thread-1] :
total send and received messages: 1, the last second 1 msgs/s
A->B->A: max 330ms, A->B->A: avg 330ms, A->B: avg 278ms, B->A: avg 52ms
```

## Getting Started

Print help information:

```bash
$> java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar --help

Client-server program for determining network round trip time.

Usage: java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar [options] [command] [command options]
  Options:
    --debug, -d
      Setup ROOT log level to DEBUG.
      Default: false
    --help, -h
      Print usage information.
  Commands:
    -p      Pitcher mode. The Pitcher (message thrower) runs on the first,
            'A', computer, and have the functionality of generating and
            sending messages to another computer.

      Usage: -p [options] <hostname>
        Options:
          -mps
            The speed of message sending expressed as 'messages per second'.
            Default: 1
        * -port
            TCP socket port used for connecting.
          -size
            Message length, minimum: 50, maximum: 3000.
            Default: 300

    -c      Catcher mode. The Catcher (message catcher) runs on the second,
            'B', computer and have the functionality of receiving the message
            and sending replies to the message sender.

      Usage: -c [options]
        Options:
        * -bind
            TCP socket bind address that will be used to run listen.
        * -port
            TCP socket port used for listening.

```

Starting **catcher** listener:

```bash
$> java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar -c -port 9090 -bind localhost
20:50:57.579 INFO  [main] : Catcher mode enabled
```

Launching the program in **pitcher** mode:

```bash
$> java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar -p -port 9090 localhost
16:36:38.379 INFO  [main] : Pitcher mode enabled
16:36:39.442 INFO  [pool-3-thread-1] :
total send and received messages: 1, the last second 1 msgs/s
A->B->A: max 330ms, A->B->A: avg 330ms, A->B: avg 278ms, B->A: avg 52ms

16:36:40.440 INFO  [pool-3-thread-1] :
total send and received messages: 2, the last second 1 msgs/s
A->B->A: max 504ms, A->B->A: avg 504ms, A->B: avg 411ms, B->A: avg 93ms

16:36:41.440 INFO  [pool-3-thread-1] :
total send and received messages: 3, the last second 1 msgs/s
A->B->A: max 504ms, A->B->A: avg 495ms, A->B: avg 138ms, B->A: avg 357ms

```

### Localization

Right now the programm supports only two languages - Russian and English. By default, it takes system's locale.

### Docker support

For fast deploying on remote host, you could build Docker image of this program and launch it with [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) test file.

How to build and launch **Docker** image:

1. build project with *docker* goal for creating program's **Docker** image:
```bash
$> mvn clean package docker:build
```

2. launch it, I prefer **docker-compose**, for that you could just type the following (in project root folder):
```bash
$> docker-compose up -d
Creating network "ping_default" with the default driver
Creating ping-catcher
```

3. let's check docker iamges:
```bash
$> docker images
REPOSITORY        TAG        IMAGE ID         CREATED            SIZE
xxlabaza/ping     1.1.1      85b405f9af66     31 minutes ago     170 MB
xxlabaza/ping     latest     85b405f9af66     31 minutes ago     170 MB
```

4. after that we can check it by launching **pitcher**:
```bash
$> java -jar ping-1.1.1.jar -p -port 9090 localhost
21:46:39.875 INFO  [main] : Pitcher mode enabled
21:46:40.933 INFO  [pool-3-thread-1] :
total send and received messages: 1, the last second 1 msgs/s
A->B->A: max 16ms, A->B->A: avg 16ms, A->B: avg 11ms, B->A: avg 5ms

...
```

## Built With

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - dependency management
* [JCommander](http://jcommander.org) - small Java framework that makes it trivial to parse command line parameters
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org) - is used to reduce boilerplate code
* [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch) - is faster logging systems
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization
